                I have always been interested in IT - from hardware components
                and computer architecture to programming languages and web
                design. For my bachelor‚Äôs degree, I chose to study Computer
                Science. Upon graduation, I proceeded to be a web developer. I
                find the merger of designing and coding to be exciting. I
                decided to pick up additional IT skills to stay relevant and
                became interested in data science. Data science continues to
                remain popular, and data scientists are in demand. With my
                current knowledge and experience, I intend to work as a data
                analyst. As I gain more work experience and domain knowledge, I
                will transition to becoming a Data Scientist, which requires the
                combination of various skill sets that goes beyond coding and
                analysing.

                I did my master‚Äôs in IT, with a specialisation in data
                analytics. My master‚Äôs course has been a holistic experience - I
                did not just gain technical IT skills, but also business
                knowledge. As a data analyst, I will be dealing with large
                volumes of data, and aiming to obtain insights to help with
                business decisions and goals. I chose to specialise in Data
                Analytics as the skills I learnt are highly transferable and can
                be of value in any organisation and sector ‚Äì government,
                education etc. The process of learning and upskilling in IT is
                continual. My knowledge and skills in data and algorithms have
                deepened due to my specialising in data analytics.

                Experience in WIL
              </h3>
              <p class="text-center text-grayishBlue md:text-left">
                My experience in WIL placement was not purely data analytics ‚Äì I
                did not handle a large dataset and obtain insights after
                exploration. Instead, the complexity, problem-solving and
                building nature made it similar to a data science project. The
                skills I learnt ‚Äì independently solving problems and building
                algorithm has given me insight into the skills I will need to
                work on to be a data scientist. The WIL placement has
                kickstarted my journey to being a data scientist, as I will need
                to upskill myself by developing mathematical and programming
                skills and understanding algorithms. Since the placement
                required solving optimization problems and implementing
                mathematical models, I can easily use these skills as a Data
                Scientist to improve machine learning models by optimizing
                parameters to the machine learning models I create.

              briefed me on the nature of the project and provided me with
              multiple technical papers to read. Initially, I felt a clear sense
              of guidance and direction as the task of reading papers seemed
              simple. I encountered many unknown terms and technical jargon once
              I started reading these papers. I felt increasingly disoriented
              and compelled to understand everything, even though the context
              and application were different to my placement. I became fixated
              with learning the applications of a certain algorithm and spent
              hours listening to YouTube tutorials and reading technical papers.
              I felt less confident about my capability, and that I was not
              ready to translate literature into code.
            </p>

            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              I believed the solution to my doubts was to obtain a depth of
              knowledge in every algorithm I encountered. I now understand that
              focusing on depth in one area (e.g., algorithm function) led to a
              considerable waste of time as being an expert on one of the many
              learning points meant less time could be allocated to learning
              other relevant information/skills. I will be needed to constantly
              learn new software, languages and domain knowledge in my career in
              IT. Hence to tackle this issue in the future, I shall compile a
              list of questions to guide my research and learning process and
              set the scope of depth and breadth for relevant topics/skills. I
              will utilise a note-taking application such as Evernote to
              consolidate my knowledge. This will help me focus, and not get
              sidetracked into learning more about a term/domain/skill than
              needed to carry out tasks. I am aware that in areas where I need
              to be an expert, delving deep into one domain will allow me to
              discern the many applications of the knowledge area.

            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              With deadlines approaching, I proceeded to try out snippets of
              code that I did not fully understand to mimic Blackbox functions.
              I was surprised when I made progress with building a model, and
              this challenged my assumption that I cannot apply with having a
              beginner level of knowledge/skills. My small achievement taught me
              that I should not doubt my capabilities and be hesitant to try
              just because I do not have expertise. Additionally, I understood
              the importance of segmenting tasks with proper time allocation and
              discipline such that all learning tasks are completed. I realised
              that not being an ‚Äúexpert‚Äù on things I learn does not make me less
              capable. It is important to recognise when a breadth of
              knowledge/skills may be more beneficial than having expertise.

              Receiving Feedback and communication methods
            </h6>
            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              <b class="text-softBlue text-2xl">A</b>fter reading numerous publications, I explored two
              algorithms in-depth without knowing if I was heading in the right
              direction. Although I wanted to be error-free in my work, I was
              uneasy about receiving negative feedback that I misunderstood
              the tasks assigned or my methods were wrong. Instead of
              approaching the placement supervisor after making small progress
              (e.g., learning about Blackbox optimization algorithms), I opted
              to do as much work as possible independently for many weeks. I
              realise that I desired to prove my capability to not just the
              supervisor, but myself. It was frustrating when I self-discovered
              that I was heading in the wrong direction as it was time-consuming
              and needed numerous trials and errors. I eventually approached the
              supervisor for guidance and validation when I could not progress
              further. After talking to the supervisor, I now understand that
              receiving feedback is not necessarily daunting as it is not harsh
              criticism. Furthermore, it does not undermine my capabilities or
              make my existing work futile, as sometimes we must experience
              failures to know what is correct. I recognise that I pressurised
              myself to be perfect, but this was not expected of me since I am
              new to many things.
            </p>

            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              I now understand that there is a distinction between overreliance
              and communicating to receive feedback. Constantly wanting to
              verify without self-exploration may come off as dependence, while
              periodically checking (e.g., once a week or fortnightly) is
              necessary. In all prospective jobs, I will work on my
              communication skills and practice asking for feedback and guidance
              whenever needed. Additionally, I shall learn to graciously accept
              and utilise both positive and negative feedback without getting
              defensive. While this skill cannot be acquired overnight, I will
              read on tips and mindfully practice it in my future workplace/s.
            </p>
            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              I communicated with my placement supervisor through emails,
              physical meetings, and video calls. I realised that physical
              meetings make me feel intimidated, and it is harder to ask
              questions and process feedback. However, I also recognised that
              for different purposes, different communication methods work best
              (e.g., for many questions, talking is better than emailing). I am
              aware that in my career, I will need to be open to all methods of
              communication and thus, I need to overcome my discomfort with
              face-to-face meetings.

              Understanding Algorithms & their Uses
            </h6>
            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              <b class="text-softBlue text-2xl">M</b>y placement supervisor gave me the task of devising an
              optimisation algorithm for Blackbox functions. He assigned me the
              task of reading multiple papers on the uses of Blackbox functions
              in various domains (e.g., mining). Before this placement, I had
              never heard of Blackbox functions or derivative free optimization
              algorithms. I knew some commonly used gradient based optimization
              algorithms (Regression, Gradient descent) and that algorithms can
              be easily implemented with libraries (e.g., Scikit-learn for
              Python).
            </p>

            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              To understand how Blackbox optimization works, I read the assigned
              readings to understand how it functions and its uses. However, the
              papers had many unfamiliar technical jargons, and it prompted
              further research. I watched numerous YouTube tutorials because
              they had more visualisations and simpler explanations than
              technical papers. After gaining a primary understanding of
              Blackbox optimization, I re-read technical papers as the technical
              jargon was more palatable. After spending considerable time
              learning about Blackbox functions, I then proceeded to explore
              open-sourced algorithm codes (e.g., on GitHub) that aim to
              optimise them. To build the optimization algorithm, I read
              existing optimization implementations on GitHub and formulated
              basic Blackbox optimization models from that knowledge. I should
              have spent more time exploring and testing algorithms that
              optimise these functions as the aim of placement was to create
              algorithms with state-of-the-art solutions/accuracy. However, now
              I have gained an intermediate level of understanding of Blackbox
              functions which will allow me to apply this knowledge in many
              domains (e.g., finance, science, engineering). This is not common
              knowledge in IT and thus, it will distinguish me from others.
              Furthermore, the research and building process improved my
              understanding of algorithms as I looked at the classes, functions,
              and parameters that define the algorithm (depth). It also gave me
              exposure to more algorithms and increased my breadth of algorithm
              knowledge. As a Data Analyst, I will be required to identify the
              most appropriate algorithm to implement on datasets. This
              experience will allow me to make better data-related choices and
              transfer optimization skills to other domains of data analytics
              such as Hyperparameter optimization (choosing the best parameters
              for a machine learning model).
            </p>
            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              I struggled to construct an optimization algorithm from scratch as
              it is a complex and time-consuming process. I learnt that in
              developing algorithms, I cannot rely entirely on existing
              algorithm codes as they are either too generic or tailored to
              specific purposes. I must first come up with the logic by being
              clear about its uses and then translate it to codes. I learnt that
              I need to improve my mathematical knowledge, especially Linear
              Algebra, which will allow me to understand how algorithms work and
              subsequently help me create and apply them better.

              <b class="text-softBlue text-2xl">I</b> was required to apply python coding skills, create datasets, and interpret mathematical notations through reading multiple research papers, which were provided by the industry partner. I have intermediate level of coding skills, but this application needed more knowledge for implementation. Hence, I learnt Bayesian statistics and Linear Algebra before implementing it from scratch in python. Learning mathematics made the process easier, and I realise that my increased mathematical literacy will make be a better data analyst. I will continue to learn relevant branches of mathematics to further improve my ability to translate literature into code. I was needed to document all my work and record process as a deliverable. I decided to document on jupyter notebook as it allows me to execute codes, write explanations and visualise. I had to understand other‚Äôs code (open-sourced) and use it accordingly. This made the process efficient and improved my ability to use numerous existing project codes. As a data analyst I will need to be resourceful. This experience gave me insight on the lifecycle of machine learning projects in a real-world industry and improved my agile project management skills. I will still need to improve my time management skills, to be able to iterate more rounds of training codes and this will need practice at a workplace. 
            </p>

            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              I was required to visualise my work to show successful implementation. I had to learn how to visualise this complex 3-D function as I had experience only for simpler charts and graphs. By the end, I had learnt more on visualisation, which is a key skill for data analyst to convey results to all audiences. I will continue to explore more visualisation methods/codes to further enhance this skill. I had to scale algorithms, to transform them from 2-D to 3-D. I did not have this skill prior to placement. I had to learnt about scaling and make changes to the algorithm codes. I succeeded in the scaling, although it took time to learn it. This placement enhanced my ability to learn mathematics, be inventive in my solution approaches, and know how to convey results to different technical and non-technical audiences.

            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              <b class="text-softBlue text-2xl">I</b> played football as part of the State Team (Uttar Pradesh) in
              India for 8 years, until I started working full-time. The team
              conducted trials periodically and those hoping to join had to
              prove their skills. I had always been passionate about football
              and wanted to play competitively. This motivated me to go beyond
              playing for school teams. Joining the state team was a competitive
              process and I had to dedicate time to practise and improve my
              skills. I managed to join the team after passing several rounds of
              trials. As a student, I had to juggle between studies and
              training, in addition to other obligations. I gained time
              management skills as I needed to plan and manage my academic and
              training schedules. As the academic workload increased with time,
              and exams overlapped match season, I found myself under a lot of
              pressure. Balancing everything required both physical and mental
              stamina, and I learnt to persevere even when it became exhausting.
              Sometimes we would lose matches and I would be disheartened.
              However, I learnt to stay motivated, with the end-goal in sight ‚Äì
              eventually winning matches.
            </p>

            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              Playing at that level meant that I could be kicked out of the team
              if my performance faltered. I had to take feedback on my
              performance from coaches in stride and actively apply it to
              improve my performance. Football requires teamwork for success.
              While all of us had our own individual role to play, I learnt how
              to work alongside every member to win a match. My decision to play
              for the state team gave me more positive experiences than I had
              anticipated.
            </p>
            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              Playing football competitively was a life-changing experience
              which gave me many transferable skills and shaped me to be who I
              am today. For any work/project, time management is a vital skill
              as I will need to juggle many tasks and meet strict deadlines. I
              will also need to be receptive to feedback as it will promote my
              personal and professional growth. While being independent is
              important, my experience of being in a team in a high-stress
              environment will allow me to be a team player in any workplace I
              join. When projects become challenging, my goal-oriented nature
              will ensure I persevere to make it a success. While I may not play
              competitively anymore, my passion for the game remains.

            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              <b class="text-softBlue text-2xl">M</b>y bachelor‚Äôs in computer science laid the foundation for my knowledge in many domains of IT. After graduation, I worked as a web developer in an IT services company. Data became a buzzword, and I gained an interest in the field of Data Analytics. While I was confident in my knowledge of coding, I did not know the processes in data analytics. I decided to pursue a master‚Äôs in IT to dedicate my time to picking up core skills (e.g., data interpretation) and further develop existing skills (e.g., coding) needed to be a data scientist. 
            </p>

            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              While both my undergraduate and postgraduate studies are on IT, the primary focus of my undergraduate studies was exposure to all fields of computer technology (e.g., software engineering, and programming languages). Meanwhile the master‚Äôs course has taught me in-depth, the core skills needed to carry out all processes in data analytics (e.g., business objectives, and visualisation of data). My undergraduate assignments consisted of simpler theoretical projects, unlike postgraduate projects that emphasize real-life data applications. Seeing how my assignment work could translate to practical uses has been pivotal in preparing me for the workplace as an IT professional. These practical projects have prompted me to create my self-initiated data projects, where I mine data and abstract insights. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              During my undergraduate studies, I was highly reliant on coursework materials as my main source of knowledge. While I did use the Internet for additional knowledge, the information explosion on the Internet became overwhelming. The master‚Äôs programme required me to be an independent learner and resourceful, so I had to learn to sieve through relevant information on the Internet. These are essential skills needed at the workplace as I will have to learn many new things on my own.
            </p>
            <h3 class="font-bold text-2xl ">Problem-solving</h3>
            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              
            During my undergraduate studies, the problems I had to solve were computational and theoretical in nature. While they were challenging to solve, the framework for the solutions were provided.  For my master‚Äôs problem, I was given more practical contexts that required me to identify issues by thinking critically and analysing potential solutions and then implementing the best solution. WIL required me to dissect the optimization problem with critical analysis and required excellent problem-solving skills. While I have scope to improve on this essential skill, the practice I obtained through various course projects and WIL will enable me to solve project problems at a workplace in a logical and efficient manner. Due to these practices, I grew to enjoy problem-solving. I intend to use datasets to answer challenging analytics questions, and other existing algorithm-related problems like in my WIL placement. At any workplace, I will face problems of various nature and problem-solving will be mandatory to overcome and/or solve them.
            </p>
            <h3 class="font-bold text-2xl ">Understanding how business works</h3>
            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              
              When I was a bachelor‚Äôs student, my understanding of a business was that it is an organisation that sells products. I related that domain to marketing as I did not study anything business-related. I believed in my career in IT, I would be required to follow instructions ‚Äì what programs to code or website designs to implement. However, having studied some aspects of business in my master‚Äôs, I learnt that the merger of business knowledge and IT skills is important for mining good insights. My postgraduate studies taught me that businesses aim to provide value in every aspect, which goes beyond selling a product/service. I now perceive businesses differently after gaining insight into IT service management processes in businesses. Since every workplace is a business, this knowledge will allow me to understand ways I can translate my technical skills to business objectives and their success.
